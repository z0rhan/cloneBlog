This is just me learning and nothing is original
Also the git history is going to be terrible as I'm still learning
Thank you

Now this might be the last commit 
The tutorial I was following is almost done with django and is now focusing on applying it
to a ready-made theme which I don't want to do.
I'll be applying what I've learned to a new project and I'll be doing it on my own.
Also, I need to catch up with CSS and JS.
